Hi, my name is ROllerozxa. If you've found anything I've made or done to be useful to you, now would be the time to send a donation. Just as a reminder of what I do:

- I develop and host [principia-web](https://principia-web.se), the new Principia community site which includes the forum and wiki (latter of which I am the primary contributor of).

- I've also done various other things related to Principia in the past, such as [archival of old game versions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2YX0BV9_FSrIOvbCQtgYLE1XirCr8UaAfXUzuxjefE/htmlview#), [old community site levels](https://archive.org/details/principia-community-level-archive) and [the wiki](https://principia-preservation-project.github.io/Wiki-archive/).

- I, singlehandedly, made the Principia source code release possible <sup>[Citation needed]</sup>, and [contribute](https://github.com/Bithack/principia/commits?author=rollerozxa) to the game's open source development now.

- I make [various content for Minetest](https://content.minetest.net/users/ROllerozxa/).

- I run The Voxelmanip Classic Server, a Minetest server.

- I run the [Voxelmanip Forums](https://forum.voxelmanip.se), a cozy forum for all your cozy foruming needs.

- Look cute. <sup>[Citation needed]</sup>

- *Probably about a dozen more things...*

Your financial support would help me offset server costs, buy a better computer, buy some soused herring...

Liberapay works using recurring donations, kinda like Patreon but run by a non-profit. If you would like to make a one-time donation then make a pledge and cancel after the first payment.
