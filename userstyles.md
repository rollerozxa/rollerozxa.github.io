Since I believe in user choice, I have compiled a list of various userstyles to change the appearance of this site. If you have a hard time reading white monospaced font on a dark background and wish for something better, these are for you.

For applying them, I recommend Stylus. It's available both for [Chromium-based](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Firefox-based](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/) browsers as an extension. Click on the extension icon, press the "(Write style for) voxelmanip.se" link, and paste the CSS code for the userstyles you want to enable. Some can even be combined together!

## Different fonts

### Roboto Slab (serif)
Serif fonts are the king of readability, even on the web, so here is a userstyle that changes the font to Roboto Slab. It is a part of the Roboto family of fonts and also my favorite serif font. ROllerozxa approved!

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Serif:wght@400;700&display=swap');
body {
	font-family: 'Roboto Serif', serif;
	font-size: 13pt;
	line-height: 1.8;
}
```
