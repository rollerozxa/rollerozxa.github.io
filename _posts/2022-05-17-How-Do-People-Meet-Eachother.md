title: How do people meet eachother?
---

I'm fuckin' lonely and I don't know where even to start. How do I like, find people? Not on the internet, but in real life. Real people. Who you can interact with in the real world, someone you can hug and be hugged back by. Outside of school, ones you actually have an interest in common with and can enjoy your time with. Do people still exist, outside of my school? Haven't checked in a while.

I think I really need that... The internet is the junk food of social interaction, and it's really starting to tear on my mental health.
