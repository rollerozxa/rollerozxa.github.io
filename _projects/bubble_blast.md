Bubble Blast is a mobile game where you press bubbles to cause chain reactions, with the goal being to get rid of all bubbles in a level in a limited amount of presses. So when I was learning LÖVE, I wanted to make a basic clone of this game, back in autumn of 2021.

Sometime later I continued working on it, polishing it into a pretty decent clone of the game that is now available for download on Google Play:
