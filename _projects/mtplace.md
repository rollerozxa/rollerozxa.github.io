mtPlace is a canvas 512x512 pixels in size. You have 24 colours at your disposal. What will you make?

It was inspired by the Reddit r/place social experiments that took place during 2017 and 2022, and is a collaborative canvas hosted as a Minetest server. You paint the canvas by placing nodes on it within Minetest, and it will show up in the map [on the website](https://mtplace.voxelmanip.se) that updates every 5 minutes.

It has been featured in the [Minetest Blog](https://blog.minetest.net/2023/03/12/February/#server-news) and dozens of players have left their mark on the server, creating a diverse landscape of everything from the players' favourite FOSS project logos, to a pride flag that they identify with.
