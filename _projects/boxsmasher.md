Box Smasher was a game originally written as the final assignment for my programming course in high school. It is a physics-based puzzle game where you throw balls at various constructions composed of boxes, and the aim is to rid the level of all boxes with a limited amount of balls.

It is currently available for Android on Google Play:

As it's made in Lua with LÖVE, it can also be played on any platform LÖVE supports, including desktop. Just download the source code and run it with the LÖVE runtime for your platform.
