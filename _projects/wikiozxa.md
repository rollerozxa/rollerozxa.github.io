Wikiozxa is a wiki software forked off of the wiki I wrote for [principia-web](/projects/principia-web). It is intended to be similar to MediaWiki, but significantly more minimal and lightweight.

Currently, it is being used for the Wiki of [Voxelmanip Classic](https://classic.voxelmanip.se/wiki/).
