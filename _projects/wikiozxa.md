Wikiozxa is a wiki software forked off of the wiki I wrote for [principia-web](/projects/principia-web). It is intended to be similar to MediaWiki, but significantly more minimal and lightweight.

It used to run both the [Voxelmanip Classic](https://classic.voxelmanip.se/wiki/) and [Cirrusboard](https://cirrus.voxelmanip.se/wiki/) wikis but ended up later being migrated onto GitHub Pages (blog post about this pending).

Currently, a fork of the software powers [The Voxelmanip Minetest Wiki](https://wiki.voxelmanip.se/).
