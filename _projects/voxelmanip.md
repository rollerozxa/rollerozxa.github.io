I've always wanted some kind of blog and site where I can write about stuff. And, as such... It was made, and you are here now.

It is a static site generated with Jekyll, originally hosted on GitHub Pages under rollerozxa.github.io, but moved over to the current voxelmanip.se once I got that domain name. Right now it's hosted on the Voxelmanip server, alongside principia-web and Voxelmanip Forums.
